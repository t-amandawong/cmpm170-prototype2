# CMPM 170 - Prototype 2

This game was made using the [crisp-game-lib by Kenta Cho] (https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib).

**Squircle Tap** is a game in which squares randomly appear with an ever-shrinking ring around it. Once the ring touches the square, you must tap on the square, and another randomly-place square with a ring (squircle) will appear. As the game goes on, the rings shrink faster, and you must tap the square before the ring disappears completely.

Have fun!!
